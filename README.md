# E-Commerce Mobile App - MyShop 

This e-commerce was made from scratch using M.E.R.N Stack, which stand for MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS. I used MongoDB as a database, because I'm more familiar with NoSQL database and it was easier for me to integrate it, express as a back-end for my app, react and redux for front-end.

It was built in a linear and progressive manner. Being full of features:
 - An area for admin to manage customers, products & orders directly from mobile phone;
 - Maked reusable components for a good workflow rate;
 - Can be a cross-platform mobile app, with minor changes (I developed only on Android, not having a MAC device to develop on IOS);
 - Fully working search within app, carousel and more features;
 - Authentification was made based on JWT (JSON Web Token);
 - Intuitive mobile design patern.
